At any given time, the collective was a group of about 6 to 12 individual members. They curated monthly exhibits in the main gallery space and organized pop up exhibitions, poetry readings, peformances, video screenings, concerts and various communinity events in the annex space. Little Berlin was home to Philadelphia's largest zine library. As an artist collective, it was unique for its focus on curation as well as its emphasis on experimental and innovative programming. All of this was in support of its overall mission to promote artists and ideas beyond the members' individual art practices.</p>
			  

			  <p>Little Berlin was located in the Viking Mill, an historic textile-mill turned artist space in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia located at Boston St. and Coral St. It was located at the back of the courtyard on Coral St.
