   <p> “Being ‘materialistic’ does not mean sticking to the triteness of facts nor does it imply a narrow mindedness that consists in reading works in purely economic terms.”<br>
   - Nicholas Bourriaud</p>
<p>Conor Backman re-creates pre-existing objects that are widely familiar with craft and humorist irony. Through the process of re-making and appropriating he creates a new, unfamiliar experience for these objects.</p>
<p>Matthew Brett creates a series of relationships between objects that are otherwise banal. Through replication, (casting, painting, carving, etc…) these recognizable, everyday objects have been frozen and rendered false. The result being physical memories in a mental landscape where the relationships between objects grow more complex and the importance of the individual artifacts fade.</p>
<p>Sean Kuhnke and Bryan Jabs examine the way people interact with printed material in a social experiment about the commodification of art and interactivity. Their work engages viewers through an uncommon form of distribution of printed media, investigating its role in both private and public space.</p>
<p>Alexandra Barao captures and appropriates elements of nature in a way that is rough and unedited resulting in a transitory and meditative video that reminds us of the comforting wonder of our immediate landscape. Her videos illustrate a time when, in a need to feel grounded, the artist begins to draw from what is directly around them for inspiration.</p>
<p>Joanie Turbek attempts to re-create the sensation of a rainstorm, particularly through it’s construction. The result is a setting that is soothing and familiar. Joanie approaches the re-appropriation of nature in a way that is minimal and humble, making the production and craft secondary to the actual experience that she has created, allowing the viewer to sit by the window and watch the rain.</p>
<p>Masha Badinter focuses on moments in her memory that she believes can be reconstructed as universal grounds for feeling. She uses elements of architecture and light to convey a past experience with an emphasis on the relationship between people and spaces. Although the narrative is from her own memory it is an open narrative that others can complete.</p>
