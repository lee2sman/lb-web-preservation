<p>little berin and Mascher Space are excited to present a two-day international networked performance festival: Low Lives 4 in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Low Lives examines works that critically investigate, challenge, and extend the potential of performance practice presented live through online broadcasting networks. These networks provide a new alternative and efficient medium for presenting, viewing, and archiving performances.</p>
<p>Now entering its fourth year, Low Lives is an international festival of live performance-based works transmitted via the internet and projected in real time at multiple venues throughout the U.S. and around the world.http://www.lowlives.net/</p>

<p>For the duration of each day of the festival, little berlin gallery will be connected via livestream to co-presenting spaces all over the world for a series of networked performances – drop-in as you wish to observe, short performances begin roughly every 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Admission: $5 Artists / $10 General Public Beverages available for a suggested donation, snacks available each evening</p>
