  Persistently mining material, architectural and organic form, and structural decay, Cindy Cheng, Magnolia Laurie, Bill Schmidt, Nick Primo, and Leyla Rzayeva respond to the intersection of these subjects with the “self” across a spectrum of art mediums. These works explore their diverse instinctual responses to the natural world through subversion of formal uses of line and structural elements. Displayed together, the artwork works describe individual investigations into current social and political narratives and the transformation of these narratives into playful  and unpredictable representations. </p>
