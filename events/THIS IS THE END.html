 <p>‘This is the End’ Exhibition Opens Friday, May 1 at Little Berlin</p>

<p>PHILADELPHIA, 2009 - Americans find themselves in a time of multiple endings. The end of prosperous financial markets. The end of the natural world as we know it. Cheap energy, newspapers, the power of domestic cars – all are ending. It is easy to let the pessimism of all these endings overwhelm us. When things end, they stop, they die; yet life is cyclical and while some things cease, others will postpone, adapt or even start anew.</p>

<p>In response to this period of multiple cessations, Little Berlin presents the exhibition, This is the End. The obvious finalities are depicted – the end of mankind and the end of life, but some more subtle readings are represented as well. The end of youth, the end of possessions, the end of aspirations – are all portrayed. The opening reception for the show is First Friday, May 1, from 6:00 – 10:00 pm. The exhibition will be open to the public from May 1 through May 30 on Saturdays from 12:00 – 5:00 pm and by appointment. </p>

This is the End was curated by Little Berlin collective member, Robert T. Pannell. The exhibition’s artists include Jon Bobby Benjamin, Ellie Brown, Justin Bursk, Jen Coluzzi, Lew Death, Conor Fields, Juan Garcia, Jenna Hannum, Morgan Hill, Terrence Laragione, Max Maddox, Amanda Miller, Christine Mladic, James Munson, Erin M. Riley, Alice Thompson, Jeremy Waltman and Maryann Worrell.</p>
