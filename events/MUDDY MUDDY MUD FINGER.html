 <div id="description"> 
   <p> From the beginning and into forever, human existence is nourished through harmonious transformation of earthly materials gathered from daily surroundings. During the month of May, Little Berlin provides a platform to explore this harmony through artistic function. Participants will paint, excavate, destruct, build, perform, and immerse themselves with earthly materials and found objects as to transform a collective space. A primitive language of mark-making, sound, and assemblage transcends our current position within a North Philly gallery into a cave of dimly lit earthly experimentation. </p>

   <p>
   There will be an opening/closing reception on Friday, May 31st(7-10pm) to exhibit the findings... <br>
   featuring music by TOTAL OBESITY<br>
