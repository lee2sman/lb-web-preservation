   <p> A social gathering of absurdist performance art, drinks, sun dance, and a crafting of mythology for the New World. The inspiration for the exhibition is derived from Plato’s Republic and the Mayan creationist text the Popol Vuh. Through a month of programming Plato’s Porno Cave seeks to create a mythology for a truly new world. Bring your friends for performances that will enchant your unconscious mind!</p>

<p>
Plato’s Porno Cave
</p>

<p>
The inspiration for the exhibition is derived from Plato’s Republic and his model for Utopia in the city Kallipolis (or “beautiful city”). In this text, Socrates defines a good city as a city where justice is its main virtue. By combining these ethics with other creationist myths such as the Mayan text, the Popol Vuh, and a surreal month of programming, Plato’s Porno cave seeks to create a mythology for a truly new world.</p>

<p>
On Saturday, March 2nd participants will be born again, entering a realm of wonder and radical opposites. Introduced upon them by the Visionaries of the Twin Beard, who created The Machine to Move the Sun, participants will be led through various orgone accumulators, sacrificing the hardships of their past in order to accept the pleasures of the present. The exhibition will be an experiment in economics, science, language, and physical reality and will stand as a stationary structure and event space throughout the month of March as a testament to the New World.</p>
