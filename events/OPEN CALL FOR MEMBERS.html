 <p> LITTLE BERLIN OPEN CALL
 </p>
 <p>
APPLICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP
 </p>
<p>
Deadline: January 15th at Midnight
</p>
<p>
Little Berlin welcomes your application for membership. We are a collective of artists and curators committed to experimental and innovative programming and exhibitions. Our focus is on visual arts, without any clearly defined expectations of what that means. Our collective is unique for its emphasis on curation and programming: members support one another to promote artists and ideas beyond the art practices of individual members.
</p>
<p>
Based in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia, we occupy facilities that can accommodate a wide range of artworks and display methods. Each member has the opportunity to create one month-long exhibition in the Little Berlin main gallery space per year (on average) and also to initiate many programs and smaller shows in our Annex space in an on-going, flexible rotation. Our collective also participates in many external events in Philadelphia and beyond. We frequently host and participate in exchanges with other artists and collectives. Each member brings vision, commitment, skills, and work-ethic to the collective; in turn, each member benefits equally from Little Berlin’s resources and reach.
</p>

At this stage you also have the opportunity to ask detailed questions to help you decide if Little Berlin is the right fit for you. Membership in Little Berlin entails pro-active involvement in your own curatorial endeavors, a commitment of several hours per month of hands-on support for the upkeep of our space and the implementation of programs, regular attendance at meetings, steady and responsive communication, and the payment of monthly member dues.
