<p>After School Special Presents: Varsity</p>
<p>Curated by: Brett Erich Suemnicht</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Opening Reception: Saturday, 12/3, 6-10 PM</p>
<p>Gallery Hours: Sundays 2-6pm</p>
<p>After School Special is an organization headed by a collective of artists seeking community engagement through nontraditional exhibitions, film screenings, queer events, informal classes, applicable workshops, malleable dialogue, and everything in between. As a group of working and emerging artists, they seeks to support creative individuals of a similar stature by providing opportunities for under recognized, socially engaged, young makers. A.S.S. engages art and community at a local, national, and international level in hopes of becoming part of the larger cultural discussion that defines us all. We are not bound by walls, but by the value of ideas and the people behind them.</p>
<p>Their collective is currently based out of a raw space in the Riverwest neighborhood of Milwaukee, WI.</p>
<p>Artists: Stephanie Lane Gage, DeAnn Guenterberg, Rachel Hausmann, Zach Hill, Elina Johann, Kayle Karbowski, Peter Klett, Kister Larson, and  Jasmine McMasters</p>
