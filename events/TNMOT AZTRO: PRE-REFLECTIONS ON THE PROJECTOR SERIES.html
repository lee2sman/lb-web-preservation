<p>Eric Preisendanz of Little Berlin and Vox Populi are excited to host a public discussion about ambition, money, race, and DIY culture with Arien Wilkerson, Director of TNMOT AZTRO’s “Projector Series”.  This conversation is meant to stimulate a deeper self-investigation that shall conclude with new awareness and emergent connections built together through the act of guided self-reflection, activated again during the following 3 night, 6 show performance at Vox Populi. The initial guiding questions are not confining or determined to:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As we contemplate the modern erosion of philanthropy-based cultural funding sources, what resource and options exist or must be created (or re-created) and distributed for privileged or nonprivileged artists seeking to establish their craft? How do we normalize and act with equality in the arts with finite fiscal resources instead of rhetoric?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As DIY galleries are predominantly lead by white art school graduates, how can their assembly and agency create a support system for POC artists? Do they have inclusion obligation, even within the system of autonomous or independent curation? What is a sustainable and fair curatorial model, if one exists?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DIY Galleries and artists are typically membership driven. At a currently challenging figure, Little Berlin is still essentially only able to afford rent (Author is treasurer). Certainly inaccessible to many emerging artists that would want to be members, the agency created by the micro/’non’-institution actually owns some of the responsibility to offer discounted rental rates, if any, to those of less privilege. How is this done fairly and sustainably?</p>

<p>Tnmot Aztro is a 7 person dance company from Hartford, CT, led by Director Arien Wilkerson Established in 2016, Tmnot Aztro has created movement experiences for sold out audiences across the east coast. The company’s performances have found success  at art galleries, institutions and incubator spaces such as The Historic Town and County Club of Hartford, the Wadsworth Atheneum, University of Saint Joseph, Scapegoat Garden Center for Contemporary Dance, Ted Hershey Dance Marathon, New Britain Museum of Art, Connecticut Dance Alliance, and the CT Dance Awards.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Arien Wilkerson is an award winning choreographer, and movement, video, and installation artist. The Hartford, CT native began his dance training within the wisdom of Jolet Creary, and has been a student at the Greater Hartford Academy of the Arts, The Artists Collective, Earl Mosley Institute of the Arts, and the Batsheva Dance Company’s “Gaga Intensive” in Tel Aviv, Israel. In 2008, he was a scholarship recipient for travel to Cape Verde, Africa to participate in CulturArte, a youth arts residency program. There, he studied with Deborah Goffe (Artistic Director of Scapegoat Garden) and Mano Preto (Artistic Director of Raiz di Polon). In his role as founder and Artistic Director of TNMOT AZTRO, Arien has been commissioned by Hartford’s Town &amp; County Club to develop his sold-out show BLACK BOY JUNGLE, which went on to sell out the Wadsworth Atheneum. As an Artist in Residence at The Garden Center for Contemporary Dance (2013-2014), Arien developed three iterations of “The Projector Series. The fourth iteration of The Projector Series went on to being the first sold out dance performance at its venue Real Art Ways in 40 years, selling out all 3 nights.   Arien served as co-facilitator for the Invisible City Project Cooperative, a space and program with the goal of supporting Greater Hartford dance artists in making their best work. Wilkerson was recently named Take Magazine’s 2017”Artist to Watch".</p>
