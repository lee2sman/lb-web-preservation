   DISTRIBUTED COLLECTIVES<br>
   An exhibition of three web-based artist groups: Computers Club, Manifest.AR and F.A.T. The artists in these groups are located in cities across the world, including Berlin, New York, London, Phoenix, Boston, Amsterdam among others – many of them have been working together closely online for years but have never met in person. This show examines the history and structure of the groups and looks at the diverse processes and approach of the artist working on the interwebz. </p>

   <p>
Work in the show ranges from creative coding projects like browser extensions and spatial recognition work, to augmented reality public art, to browser-based motion art and physical installations.
