 <div id="description"> 
 <p> λόγος (Lógos) considers the Postructuralist premise that the distinctions we make are not necessarily given by the world around us, but are instead produced by the symbolizing systems we learn. The Greek term “Lógos” has no direct translation to English but can be understood as a reference to philosophical Reason, meaning, or word. This exhibition investigates the role that design plays in three geographically disparate studio practices, functioning as a pragmatic approach to production and as a counterpoint to the meaning derived from appropriated material and synthetic symbolism.

<p>
With new processes and an endless list of new materials at their disposal, the artist, craftsman, and designer now suffer from the tyranny of absolute choice. When everything becomes possible, when all the limitations are gone, design and art can easily become a never-ending search for novelty [or meaning], and the desire for novelty on the part of the artist becomes an equally strong desire for novelty on the part of the spectator and consumer, until newness-for-the-sake-of-newness becomes the only measure. It is at this point that many different versions of novelty begin to create many different esoteric consumer cliques, and the designer with their wares may become more and more alienated from their society and the functional complex.
