 <div id="description"> 
   <p> SCENE is an exhibition of International artists working with the performative aspects of the ceramic object. The artists employ alternative devices such as video, architecture, photography and performance to activate the typically static ceramic art object. The main focus of the show is to change the audience’s awareness of and interaction with the gallery as public space. Our perceptions are challenged as we consider the transition of private to public, actor to audience or author to reader.</p>
