   <p> "Plants grow and whither, salt sets, bodies deteriorate whilst human being stumbles ahead of itself – always one step behind." – Julie Bitsch</p>

About the show
   </p><p>
Through an elaborate installation of plaster and bronze imprints, human hair and nails, water, salt, ready-mades and infinite amounts of vacuum Danish artist Julie Bitsch explores the peculiar temporality of contemporary, globalized culture. With odd humor, acute material intelligence and elusive political annotations Bitsch creates an exhibition-event that plays out in the gap between the perpetual 'getting there' and simply being here.
