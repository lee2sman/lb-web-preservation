   <p> SWING STATE</p>

<p>AN EXHIBITION OF TOPOGRAPHY AND BODY Curated by Rebekah Flake  </p>
<p>November 5-27, 2016 at Little Berlin Opening Reception: Saturday, November 5th, 6-10 PM Post-Election Recovery Roundtable, Tuesday, November 15th, 7 PM Closing Reception and Catalog Release, Sunday, November 27th, 3-5 PM</p>
<p>SWING STATE examines the intersection of self and site. Each work of art in this group exhibition stems from the artists’ highly personal responses to the power dynamics of place on the embodied subject. The selected projects reveal a few of the topographic peaks and canyons of the American cultural landscape. From the art spaces of Philadelphia to the rural swamps of the American South to the feminist archives to the evening news, these artists traverse different American territories, and reveal a handful of the complicated and seductive social conditions we face in this moment of choosing (or dreading) our next President.</p>
<p>In addition to the opening reception, a Post-Election Recovery Roundtable will be held one week following the closing of the polls. After a live performance and satirical gallery tour by Kristen Mills, the group will discuss how we individually and collectively plan to move forward post election. What are the dangers / what are the benefits facing artists? the city? the country? How do we personalize the changes to our communities? All are welcome.</p>
