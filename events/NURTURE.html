   <p> Nurture is an exhibition featuring work that considers the self as it comes up against the social and environmental factors that it has been nurtured into and those that it continues to nurture in turn. The works in this exhibition are illustrative in nature and frequently surreal - mirroring the absurdity of being a person in the world.</p>
