 <p> Little Berlin is proud to present Heaven on Earth, an exhibition of eighteen
artists curated by Sam Belkowitz, which tackles the ambitious task of mining
oneâ€™s search for utopia. In this exhibition, Belkowitz asks each artist: where do
you find perfection? Are the ideals of utopia even possible or attainable? These
works coalesce into an environment without limits at Little Berlin, providing
the viewer with a series of vantage points from which to experience the
paradoxical nature of utopian dreams. Please join us at Little Berlin to
experience Heaven on Earth.
