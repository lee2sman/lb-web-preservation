a free showing of two works in progress

Featuring "Third Party Consequences" by choreographer Megan Mizanty, in collaboration with composer Sabrina Clarke
and "Third Human Arm" by Choreographer Rori Smith, in collaboration with filmmakers Sam Campbell and Claire Truman

Performers: Claire Lutz, Kate Abernethy, Julee Mahon, Emma MacDonald, Sam Campbell, Rori Smith and Claire Truman 

In “Third Party Consequences,” Mizanty explores movement that doesn’t give a shit. She is interested in ‘the butterfly effect,’ and how small decisions made by one body part undually and significantly affects another, for better or worse. Composer Sabrina Clarke works with and against this movement.

In "Third Human Arm" dancer Rori Smith and filmmakers Sam Campbell and Claire Truman collaborate to explore the possible uses of Steadicam in live performance. Smith and Truman dance while Campbell operates the Steadicam, a wearable camera mount designed to maintain a smooth and stable picture while the camera operator moves through the performance space. A live video stream from the camera provides the audience a chance to witness the dance from a variety of perspectives, including through the eyes of the dancers. 

The collaboration for Third Human Arm began while Smith and Campbell worked together on a short film. Witnessing Campbell operate the Steadicam, Smith recognized that the craft demands an awareness of the body in space and an attention to movement detail similar to dance. This performance tests how Campbell’s moving body might integrate with the movements of the dancers on stage. The choreography is inspired by the purpose of the Steadicamhi, to maintain stability within uninhibited mobility.</p>
