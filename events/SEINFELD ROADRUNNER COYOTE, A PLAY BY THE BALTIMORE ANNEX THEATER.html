 <div id="description"> 
   <p> Remember the 25-person touring stage adaptation of Fantastic Planet that so many of you crammed in to see at the Ox? or A Fistful of Flowers, the trans western, at Little Berlin? The Annex Theater is coming through Philly for ONE NIGHT ONLY with another craftastical adventure, as well as the premiere of TWO BONERS PIZZA DELIVERY SERVICE on our outdoor grill!! That's right. Pizza. </p>

   <p>SEINFELD ROADRUNNER COYOTE features Coyote as Jerry Seinfeld, convinced by Elaine, Kramer, and George to try internet dating as a means of catching The Roadrunner. Coyote's ingenious ploy to impersonate a female roadrunner on the web proves futile in person. Puppets and mechanistic traps lead the way to his inevitable demise and urgent need for medical attention back in his expensive Manhattan apartment.</p>

   <p>$5-$10 suggested donation <br>
(plus some pizza donations plz)</p>
