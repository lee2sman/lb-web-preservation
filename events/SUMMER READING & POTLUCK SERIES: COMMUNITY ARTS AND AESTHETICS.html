   <p> Join Little Berlin member Erin Bernard (of the Philadelphia Public History Truck) for a three-month Summer Reading BYOB potluck series on Community Arts and Aesthetics in the new Little Berlin Annex.Â </p>

   <p>The event is no cost, but a small donation is suggested toward the Annex. Please come with a dish to share and/or a drink of choice, an open mind, and some thoughts from your independent exploration of the texts that relate to your or other current work.</p>

   <p>RSVP is required because space is limited. All genres and disciplines are welcome to attend. Please RSVP to Erin phillyhistorytruck@gmail.com to be added to the attendee list, for event-related updates, and for video links to supplementary video lectures. Let's eat together and learn from each other.</p>

We will discuss artists, curators, exhibition designers, historians such as Theaster Gates, Sam Durant, Mel Chin, Nina Simon, Rick Lowe, Michael Frisch, as well as other talks from the Creative Time Summit of 2013 .
 </p>
<p>
Does community arts have an aesthetic? What is it? How do interdisciplinary creatives and community artists fit into larger conversations on aesthetics? Why should or should we not consider public history participatory art? How should we use the term social practice in 2014? Do any of these questions even matter at all?
