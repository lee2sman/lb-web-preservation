<p>Falolo (Fah-­lóh-­loh) ­  1. Something more than awesome. It is the best thing ever. (From the Urban Dictionary)</p>
<p>Falolo 4Ever questions such paradigms as “traditional lifestyle”, the Latin American construct and gender normativity by exploring non­whiteness, post­colonialism, regional language and sex positivity.</p>
<p>All artists included in this exhibition attended TrueQué Residency 2016 http://www.trueque.work/ TrueQue is a residence for emerging artists, activists and cultural managers whose practice reflects on being latin American inside and outside Ecuador. TrueQue seeks to create a space or creative exploration where research, networking and cross­disciplinary practices become an integral part of the process of creating art . </p>
<p>During the TrueQue residency, there was much discussion regarding gender, physicality and language. Americanisms such as the word “queer” become globally adopted, sometimes having lasting effects unforeseen by those that coined the term. In North America, sometimes we forget that we are part of a larger continent also dealing with the aftermath of Colonialism and violently enforced heteronormativity. Falolo 4Ever seeks to act as a reminder that queerness is greater than sexual preference, more encompassing than a first­world movement granting us access to the bathroom of our choice. Queerness is a reminder that consent comes first, and that as adult humans we have the right to give our hearts and bodies to whomever we choose.   </p>
