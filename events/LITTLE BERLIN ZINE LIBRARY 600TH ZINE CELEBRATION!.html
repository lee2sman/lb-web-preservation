   <p>Little Berlin Zine Library 600th Zine Celebration!</br>
Location: Little Berlin, 2430 Coral Street<br>
Date: January 9 at 6-10PM</p>

<p>In honor of our 600th zine donation, this Friday, January 9 come peruse one of Philadelphia’s largest zine collections at Little Berlin. The Little Berlin Zine Library began by former member and Philadelphia performance artist Beth Heinly in 2009. Since its founding the collection has grown and amassed to its present 600 zines including artist books, catalogs, comix, art criticism journals, poetry, perzines, photozines, fiction and much more. Our newest zines were collected at zine fairs in Baltimore and New York this year and a recent haul of zines from Half Letter Press. While normally available to the public at all of our events on a moving cart in the Little Berlin Annex, on January 9 they will be displayed in our main gallery.</p>

<p>Please bring zines you’d like to donate to the collection, and if you can, bring two. We donate 2nd copies to Temple University’s Special Collections for the new Little Berlin Zine Archive.</p>
