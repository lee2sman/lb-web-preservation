Throughout November, artist-run spaces throughout Philadelphia have hosted CITYWIDE: A Collective Exhibition. Now it’s Little Berlin’s turn! Join us this Saturday at Pterodactyl Gallery as we present The Citywide Collections Project. After months of picking up and sorting donated objects left in our collection bins by anonymous collaborators, our efforts have culminated in this odd, surprising, quirky, wry, uncertain assemblage of items. Objects were curated by Little Berlin into ten categories:</p>
<p>
Lost,<br>
Found,<br>
Intimate,<br>
From a stranger,<br>
Radical,<br>
Boring,<br>
Valuable,<br>
Worthless,<br>
Missing a part, and<br>
Part of something else.
<p>

<p>
Hosted by Pterodactyl and featuring refreshments and music, the opening runs from 7-10pm at 3237 Amber St, 5th Floor. We invite you to additional objects meeting one or more of the above criteria to add to the collection throughout the evening.
