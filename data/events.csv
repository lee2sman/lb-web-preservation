        ","Nurture is an exhibition featuring work that considers the self as it comes up against the social and environmental factors that it has been nurtured into and those that it continues to nurture in turn. The works in this exhibition are illustrative in nature and frequently surreal - mirroring the absurdity of being a person in the world.

The onset of the digital horizon has brought us to an overstimulated present full of contradiction. Unanswered sentimentality expressed in a crowd. We clutch to the endless informational expanse seeking some sort of salvation. Unlimited signs can be found in the excess and yet so many searches yield empty returns. In uncertain times, we install systems of faith for intimacy. Reaching out into the noise in an attempt to reconcile with the ultimate loss of ground to stand on.

Featured Artists:

Rachel Eng, Christian Filardo, & Saskia Krafft


In 1992, Journalist Andrew C. Revkin, wrote: ""Perhaps earth scientists of the future will name this new post-Holocene period for its causative element—for us. We are entering an age that might someday be referred to as, say, the Anthrocene. After all, it is a geological age of our own making.” The first documented use of this word, Revkin’s article introduced into common vernacular an idea which described a powerful shift in understanding; By altering climate, landscapes, and seascapes as well as flows of species, genes, energy, and materials, we are sealing the fates of myriad other species. And, without a big shift from business-as-usual, we will undermine our own long-term welfare as well. After 27 years of percolation and debate, anthrocene (or the more common anthropocene) has become the closest thing there is to common shorthand for this turbulent, momentous, unpredictable, hopeless, hopeful time—duration and scope still unknown.


This exhibition brings together three artists examining the role of the human in the role of a broad and plastic understanding of a world ecosystem. The works of Rachel Eng, Christian Filardo, and Saskia Krafft all grapple with the tension between the individual and the accumulated. Tasked with reconciling their places in the world, the assembled artists each act as explorers of well-trod landscapes. Their methods act as systems of mapping, orienting both the artist and the viewer in relation to a world changing at a blistering rate. In the process, the collected works give the viewer an opportunity to meditate on the space of the individual as a piece of the the collective and reflect on the anthropocentrism of the world we recommit to on a daily basis.

Lancaster is a small city. Our population falls just shy of 60,000 and our downtown is comprised of only a handful of city blocks. Most folks from outside of the area are only really familiar with us because of the colorful veneer of “Amish Country”, the outlet mall-based tourism or the amount of best-of lists we’ve been featured on in the past few years (which is confusing even to us).

We’re a city that is often romanticized or written-off all together. But for those of us living in Lancaster, it’s a home like any other where joy and disappointment bump shoulders passing in the hall and causes for both celebration and frustration are exchanged over dinner. Lancaster is a place where serious work is being done, frequently without fanfare or outside acknowledgment.

The goal of this show is to highlight folks living and working in Lancaster who are driving forward important conversations in their work ranging in topic from celebrations of racial heritage and yearning for communal belonging to the comedic and absurd to frank views of sex, community and assault. The stories are real and offer a slice-of-life view into the experiences of artists living in a place that typically only ever garners a passing glance and a reputation for being quaint.

Quaint includes visual art by Salina Almanzar, Emily Bayless, Michael Benevenia, James Hollenbaugh, Victoria Kue, Osmyn Oree, Arthur Oak Padelsky and Paolo Puck. This exhibition was curated by Henry Gepfer

Also on view is a selection of Lancaster-based literature and zines curated by Tyler Barton and Erin Dorney. This selection includes work by Salina Almanzar, Mike Andrelczyk, Erik Anderson, Tyler Barton, Jamie Beth Cohen, Meg Day, John Salvino and Annajane Dauphine, Erin Dorney, Fledgling Rag, Elizabeth Gonzalez, Le Hinton, Meghan Kenny, Travis and JenMarie Macdonald, Libby Modern, Nicholas Montemarano, Jeff Rath, Daina Savage, Lina Seijo, Halley Weaver, Jennifer Hill and Dan Waber, and Jacob Ross Yohn.

Tango, this powerful dance of confrontation, submission, and support gives kinetic representation to our interactions as a successful artist collective. The defining operational principle of “The Front” is one of collaboration, which involves unabashed and direct communication. We are kind and supportive of our members, while at the same time, not afraid to express confrontational opinions in our monthly meetings. We participate in a group tango of trust, to bring exciting and rewarding programming to our unique gallery space on a monthly basis.

To honor our spirit of collaboration, we channel the idea of working with others for the “Tango” exhibition. We each have our own distinctive approach, and present works that explore relationships with other humans, with other animals, with the environment, and with history. The works are as varied as our members, and the excitement of this accumulation is testament to the power of working together in an open and forthright manner.

The artists explore the precarious position of the contemporary art-worker though text paintings, textured sculptures, receipt logs, and their life ""experience"". 

This exhibition acknowledges that the typical working artist does not get paid for their art-work and must engage in freelance work to keep their practice afloat, in addition to the unpaid work they do in the hopes that they will “get their break” in the future. During the broad separation of art and work that happened during the industrial era, labor-value became limited to profitable production as the basis for work. This reduced the cultural producer to hobbyist and has led to the glorification of sacrifice in the arts with a belief that creativity is nourished through suffering and pain. The EDGE OF PRECARITY asserts intellectual or cultural production as an alternative to material production, and declare it be given a higher status in society.

PERFORMANCE BY KRISTINE RUNMAN 7PM

""Where do we belong and where we are from?"" are kinds of questions that are always tied to the idea of territory. Day by day migration is becoming a vital issue in our world. Due in part to globalization, land and identity are frequently viewed from a variety of different perspectives; sometimes even a misinformed or directly opposing perspective. But this issue gives us the opportunity to investigate those individuals who deal with and express their thoughts about the complexity of land. “Nostalgia of Land” is bringing three artists Kristine Rumman, David F Walsh and Stave Yosha, who deal with the complexity and the politics of the land which relates to their personal history. That history is different for each of them, but one common thread is perspective. It’s historical, identical, and maybe in a certain way ideological. They might, might not stay in that land or on that history, but they dig their attachment, their belonging to the land. There is somehow a tone of losing or maybe a portion of darkness which reflects their honesty to their work. ""Nostalgia of Land"" proudly combines these three artists to enhance our thinking and ideas on these ongoing issues of our society.

Weathered Dreams
Opening on Saturday, June 30th from 6-9 PM
Exhibition on view until July 15th.

Little Berlin is pleased to present an exhibition of works by Alejandra Zavala, Graciela Vasquez and Candy Alexandra González entitled “Weathered Dreams”. This group of artists explores issues of intersectional identity and migration through illustration, mixed media and installation artwork. At a time when social media has made ICE raids, deportations and the incarceration of immigrants available for consumption, it is critical to uplift the works of artists who are directly impacted by anti-immigrant policies. Weathered Dreams was curated by Candy Alexandra with the intention of centering young, Latinx, people of color, immigrant/children of immigrant narratives. Each of the artist’s pieces will be exhibited alongside zines from the Little Berlin zine collection that are in direct conversation with the core themes of the exhibition.

The opening for Weathered Dreams is being organized in collaboration with Juntos, a community-led, Latinx immigrant organization based in South Philadelphia. The opening event will provide attendees the opportunity to learn more about Juntos’ initiatives and ways to better support Philadelphia’s immigrant communities. 

~

Alejandra Zavala’s passion for art started at a young age. She is inspired by the colorful surroundings of her childhood in Mexico--from her abuelita's apron and beautiful garden of exotic flowers, to the altar they built together every Día de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) and the fruit stands her family ate from daily. Alejandra’s artwork is rooted in the heartbreak of leaving her homeland, a blending of cultures and the comfort of new friendships.

Alejandra is a Lancaster based artist. She received her BA from Franklin & Marshall College in 2016.

~

Graciela Vasquez (Chelitasdesign) is a Latinx artist/activist who dedicates their time to representing their family's history through art. After their father was deported to his home country in 2006, Graciela focused their art on their Latinx heritage, immigrant’s rights and religious influences. Graciela hopes that sharing their experiences through their artwork will impact those who see themselves reflected in the work.

Graciela is a first generation college graduate and received their BFA from Moore College of Art & Design in May 2018. 

~

Candy Alexandra González is a Latinx papermaker, printmaker, book artist and young poet from Miami, FL. In their visual and written work, Candy Alexandra centers the narratives of Latinx immigrants and captures the essence of their own experiences as a first generation Latinx immigrant in the United States. 

Candy Alexandra received their BA in Romance Languages and Literature from Mount Holyoke College in 2014 and their MFA in Book Arts and Printmaking from The University of the Arts in 2017.

In addition,

Please join us for the closing reception of HICKEY, including works by Max Adrian, Kyle Vu-Dunn, Stephen Grebinski, Paul Peng, Curtis Welteroth and Justin Woody. The exhibition is curated by Fred Blauth and Eric Anthony Berdis.

HICKEY irreverently presents tales of intimacy and identity through the works of six queer men. By using traditional mediums such as paint, paper, pencil and fiber, then subverting their applications, the artists in the exhibition simultaneously make light of and shine light on, the absurdities of finding one’s self and then sharing with another. 

Aphrodisiacs have been sculpted from paper. Furries search for love. Dream homes become haunted houses. Floor to ceiling tapestries have been woven from hair. Voodoo dolls become dog toys. Beauty hurts. In an age where hetero normative social standards have begun to slip back into the LGBTQIA+ community, the artists in HICKEY stand by the strangeness that accompanies queerness.

When visualizing domesticity one may imagine some elements of a fleeting idea of a vision of a home in the suburbs with two kids and a dog. What is presented and explored as a theme throughout the curation of the show is all the ways that the “ideal life” does not actually exist. And yet, americans are constantly bombarded with imagery, fashion and merchandise that rely on a heteronormative ideal. The goal of this show is to blend schema that relate to each artists experience of domesticity with elements of abstraction to create new associations with how we explore and celebrate our lives.

 

The artists in A HOME IS WHAT IS HOME showcase artwork that reinvents the schema prevalent in ads, interior design and fashion to create a curated space that represents some of the ways that life and the things we live with are all different, and therefore beautiful. In the way which there are multiple forms of artwork representing multiple viewpoints, the curatorial goal is to create a space in which the guests leave the show with new ways of viewing their own lives and those of others.",

In Recommendation for a Landmark, Danica Radoshevich has created a body of work exploring the dissociative space of American motorways. Mining the forms of strip malls, roadways and construction signage, Radoshevich’s new pieces reflect on the structures made invisible through constant overexposure in daily urban life. Sitting in between painting, sculpture and installation, these artworks ask the audience to reconsider the mental geographies of banal lived experience, embracing a new context for the unassuming.

Based in the Kensington neighborhood of Philadelphia, we occupy facilities that can accommodate a wide range of artworks and display methods. Each member has the opportunity to create one month-long exhibition in the Little Berlin main gallery space per year (on average) and also to initiate many programs and smaller shows in our Annex space in an on-going, flexible rotation. Our collective also participates in many external events in Philadelphia and beyond. We frequently host and participate in exchanges with other artists and collectives. Each member brings vision, commitment, skills, and work-ethic to the collective; in turn, each member benefits equally from Little Berlin’s resources and reach.

WE INVITE YOU TO SUBMIT THE FOLLOWING MATERIALS VIA EMAIL TO BERLIN.LITTLE@GMAIL.COM.

The collective will meet with all finalists in person before extending invitations to join Little Berlin. At this stage you also have the opportunity to ask detailed questions to help you decide if Little Berlin is the right fit for you.

Kwassa Kwassa

Kwassa Kwassa is a film work by SUPERFLEX portraying the construction of a boat on the island of Anjouan, in the Comoro archipelago between Madagasgar and Mozambique. Although usually used for fishing, boats like the one built in the film are in many cases also used for transporting migrants to the neighbouring island of Mayotte, a French oversea territory and the outermost region of the EU. The islands are 70 km apart – separated by a seemingly short, but life-threatening journey that has claimed more than 10,000 lives of women, men and children. Kwassa Kwassa interprets the boat as a contextual construction intended to carry migrants on a dangerous, politically complex journey. Carrying more than symbolic meaning as a vessel for dreams of reaching a better life on the other shore, the boat is also a labor-intensive work of craftsmanship and the physical passage bearing human lives to safety – as the title questions in translation “an unstable boat” from the language of the Comoro Islands.

The Forgotten Space

The Forgotten Space follows container cargo aboard ships, barges, trains and trucks, listening to workers, engineers, planners, politicians, and those marginalized by the global transport system. We visit displaced farmers and villagers in Holland and Belgium, underpaid truck drivers in Los Angeles, seafarers aboard mega-ships shuttling between Asia and Europe, and factory workers in China, whose low wages are the fragile key to the whole puzzle. And in Bilbao, we discover the most sophisticated expression of the belief that the maritime economy, and the sea itself, is somehow obsolete.

A range of materials is used: descriptive documentary, interviews, archive stills and footage, clips from old movies. The result is an essayistic, visual documentary about one of the most important processes that affects us today. The Forgotten Space is based on Sekula’s Fish Story, seeking to understand and describe the contemporary maritime world in relation to the complex symbolic legacy of the sea.

        ","λόγος (Lógos) considers the Postructuralist premise that the distinctions we make are not necessarily given by the world around us, but are instead produced by the symbolizing systems we learn. The Greek term “Lógos” has no direct translation to English but can be understood as a reference to philosophical Reason, meaning, or word. This exhibition investigates the role that design plays in three geographically disparate studio practices, functioning as a pragmatic approach to production and as a counterpoint to the meaning derived from appropriated material and synthetic symbolism.

 

With new processes and an endless list of new materials at their disposal, the artist, craftsman, and designer now suffer from the tyranny of absolute choice. When everything becomes possible, when all the limitations are gone, design and art can easily become a never-ending search for novelty [or meaning], and the desire for novelty on the part of the artist becomes an equally strong desire for novelty on the part of the spectator and consumer, until newness-for-the-sake-of-newness becomes the only measure. It is at this point that many different versions of novelty begin to create many different esoteric consumer cliques, and the designer with their wares may become more and more alienated from their society and the functional complex.

The initial guiding questions are not confining or determined to:

 

As we contemplate the modern erosion of philanthropy-based cultural funding sources, what resource and options exist or must be created (or re-created) and distributed for privileged or nonprivileged artists seeking to establish their craft? How do we normalize and act with equality in the arts with finite fiscal resources instead of rhetoric?

 

As DIY galleries are predominantly lead by white art school graduates, how can their assembly and agency create a support system for POC artists? Do they have inclusion obligation, even within the system of autonomous or independent curation? What is a sustainable and fair curatorial model, if one exists?

 

DIY Galleries and artists are typically membership driven. At a currently challenging figure, Little Berlin is still essentially only able to afford rent (Author is treasurer). Certainly inaccessible to many emerging artists that would want to be members, the agency created by the micro/’non’-institution actually owns some of the responsibility to offer discounted rental rates, if any, to those of less privilege. How is this done fairly and sustainably?

 

Tnmot Aztro is a 7 person dance company from Hartford, CT, led by Director Arien Wilkerson Established in 2016, Tmnot Aztro has created movement experiences for sold out audiences across the east coast. The company’s performances have found success  at art galleries, institutions and incubator spaces such as The Historic Town and County Club of Hartford, the Wadsworth Atheneum, University of Saint Joseph, Scapegoat Garden Center for Contemporary Dance, Ted Hershey Dance Marathon, New Britain Museum of Art, Connecticut Dance Alliance, and the CT Dance Awards.

 

Arien Wilkerson is an award winning choreographer, and movement, video, and installation artist. The Hartford, CT native began his dance training within the wisdom of Jolet Creary, and has been a student at the Greater Hartford Academy of the Arts, The Artists Collective, Earl Mosley Institute of the Arts, and the Batsheva Dance Company’s ""Gaga Intensive"" in Tel Aviv, Israel. In 2008, he was a scholarship recipient for travel to Cape Verde, Africa to participate in CulturArte, a youth arts residency program. There, he studied with Deborah Goffe (Artistic Director of Scapegoat Garden) and Mano Preto (Artistic Director of Raiz di Polon). In his role as founder and Artistic Director of TNMOT AZTRO, Arien has been commissioned by Hartford’s Town & County Club to develop his sold-out show BLACK BOY JUNGLE, which went on to sell out the Wadsworth Atheneum. As an Artist in Residence at The Garden Center for Contemporary Dance (2013-2014), Arien developed three iterations of ""The Projector Series. The fourth iteration of The Projector Series went on to being the first sold out dance performance at its venue Real Art Ways in 40 years, selling out all 3 nights.   Arien served as co-facilitator for the Invisible City Project Cooperative, a space and program with the goal of supporting Greater Hartford dance artists in making their best work. Wilkerson was recently named Take Magazine’s 2017 ""Artist to Watch"".

May 20th

8 pm in the annex

Mark McCloughan and Toby Altman present a performance by Mark McCloughan of excerpts from Toby Altman's Arcadia, Indiana (Plays Inverse, 2017). Arcadia, Indiana is a mutant tragedy, a five act-sonnet sequence, staged in the trash-choked landscape of pastoral fantasy. It plays with narrative, labor, sexuality, and form, starting with a murder in an Indiana steel factory and ending with the Sphinx refusing all of Oedipus’ solutions to her riddles. This play is a Renaissance tragedy in contemporary drag, destabilizing literary boundaries to develop a poetics of trash, in which the repressed and discarded parts of (literary) history return to strangle their point of origin.

After School Special is an organization headed by a collective of artists seeking community engagement through nontraditional exhibitions, film screenings, queer events, informal classes, applicable workshops, malleable dialogue, and everything in between. As a group of working and emerging artists, they seeks to support creative individuals of a similar stature by providing opportunities for under recognized, socially engaged, young makers. A.S.S. engages art and community at a local, national, and international level in hopes of becoming part of the larger cultural discussion that defines us all. We are not bound by walls, but by the value of ideas and the people behind them.

Their collective is currently based out of a raw space in the Riverwest neighborhood of Milwaukee, WI.

Artists: Stephanie Lane Gage, DeAnn Guenterberg, Rachel Hausmann, Zach Hill, Elina Johann, Kayle Karbowski, Peter Klett, Kister Larson, and  Jasmine McMasters

Opening Reception: Saturday, November 5th, 6-10 PM
Post-Election Recovery Roundtable, Tuesday, November 15th, 7 PM
Closing Reception and Catalog Release, Sunday, November 27th, 3-5 PM

SWING STATE examines the intersection of self and site. Each work of art in this group exhibition stems from the artists' highly personal responses to the power dynamics of place on the embodied subject. The selected projects reveal a few of the topographic peaks and canyons of the American cultural landscape. From the art spaces of Philadelphia to the rural swamps of the American South to the feminist archives to the evening news, these artists traverse different American territories, and reveal a handful of the complicated and seductive social conditions we face in this moment of choosing (or dreading) our next President.

In addition to the opening reception, a Post-Election Recovery Roundtable will be held one week following the closing of the polls. After a live performance and satirical gallery tour by Kristen Mills, the group will discuss how we individually and collectively plan to move forward post election. What are the dangers / what are the benefits facing artists? the city? the country? How do we personalize the changes to our communities?
All are welcome.

        ","Little Berlin is pleased to present Jim Grilli: ""Gallery Copy"" on view in The Annex from August 17th through August 29th 2016. This will be the artist’s first show with the gallery. Please join us on August 20th at 7:00 for a reading by the artist followed by a reception.

Gallery Copy is a project that comprises three aspects of Grilli’s studio practice: appropriation, prose writing, and public reading. 

Selected objects in the exhibition are juxtaposed with literary fragments written by the artist that serve as makeshift wall labels. Each scrap of paper offers an allegorical justification for the appearance of the corresponding item. Some of the arrangements unaccompanied by writing play the role of quirky theatrical props that the artist will interact with during his reading, while others remain opaque in their placement. Throughout the show there is a tension between the homely appearance of the objects and what the snippets of narrative convey about their histories as enigmatic formations. 

Through activating the contents of the gallery the reading will transform the environment into a stage set of sorts as it duplicates and contradicts “the script” of the exhibition available in booklets for attendees to peruse. These two texts: one available as an oratorical statement, the other as an unrealized theatre script, convey to the reader/listener a multi-sided personae that struggles in vain to articulate a specific condition of alienation.

These three components are placed in dissonant conversation with one another to create an atmosphere that problematizes the roles works of art simultaneously play as potential instruments of financial speculation and mundane interventions that radically change the character of a given space.",x

1. Something more than awesome. It is the best thing ever. (From the Urban Dictionary)

Falolo 4Ever questions such paradigms as “traditional lifestyle”, the Latin American construct and gender normativity by exploring non­whiteness, post­colonialism, regional language and sex positivity.

All artists included in this exhibition attended TrueQué Residency 2016 http://www.trueque.work/ TrueQue is a residence for emerging artists, activists and cultural managers whose practice reflects on being latin American inside and outside Ecuador. TrueQue seeks to create a space or creative exploration where research, networking and cross­disciplinary practices become an integral part of the process of creating art . 

During the TrueQue residency, there was much discussion regarding gender, physicality and language. Americanisms such as the word “queer” become globally adopted, sometimes having lasting effects unforeseen by those that coined the term. In North America, sometimes we forget that we are part of a larger continent also dealing with the aftermath of Colonialism and violently enforced heteronormativity. Falolo 4Ever seeks to act as a reminder that queerness is greater than sexual preference, more encompassing than a first­world movement granting us access to the bathroom of our choice. Queerness is a reminder that consent comes first, and that as adult humans we have the right to give our hearts and bodies to whomever we choose.

        ","""Plants grow and whither, salt sets, bodies deteriorate whilst human being stumbles ahead of itself – always one step behind."" – Julie Bitsch

About the show

Through an elaborate installation of plaster and bronze imprints, human hair and nails, water, salt, ready-mades and infinite amounts of vacuum Danish artist Julie Bitsch explores the peculiar temporality of contemporary, globalized culture. With odd humor, acute material intelligence and elusive political annotations Bitsch creates an exhibition-event that plays out in the gap between the perpetual 'getting there' and simply being here. 

About the artist

Julie Bitsch (b. 1979) holds an MFA from the royal academy of Copenhagen (2010) and has exhibited her work in Europe, China and recently Cuba; Jet Lag will be Bitsch' first exhibition in the US.

Coming to Terms is a group exhibition dissecting the limitations of language. The show features work from four artists who mythologize the meaning of words, show gradual adaptations in storytelling, and expose the inevitable misunderstandings that emerge from multiple forms of communication.

The exhibition includes a range of media, such as videos with subtitles and eye-tracking technology, sumi ink drawings, handmade flyers, takeaway postcards, and self-published newspapers. Varied techniques of expression attempt to simulate the different ways information is distributed. Debate, reenactment, interpretation, translation, storytelling, handwriting, letters, advertising, and journalism are considered, corresponding in a frantic, nonverbal call-and-response to uncover the indefinable. 

Coming to Terms shows the contradiction of language interpretation; the inadequacies of the rational mind to “come to terms”, and the point at which we leave those terms behind. This empathetic study calls attention to the paradoxes inevitable in language, bringing us closer to the creation of alternative, newer forms of expression.

Curator Maddie Hewitt continues with similar themes and tactics from her last exhibition at Little Berlin, Hard To Please. Her curatorial projects reveal her preoccupation with omnipresent human desires, disposition, and language in order to understand human interaction and its struggles.

Artist: Will Owen
Curated by Maddie Hewitt

For the exhibit Hard To Please, curated by Maddie Hewitt at Little Berlin, New York artist Will Owen has brought kudzu vines back to Philadelphia illegally sent through USPS from a rural town in the Smokey Mountains. Kudzu and the other invasive plants are on the “orange team” and the more traditionally cultivated plants are on the “purple team.”

Floral Kombat is a small scale experiment demonstrating how invasive plant species overrun other plants in their immediate vicinity if left unattended. This time based installation includes invasive plants--kudzu and peppermint--that grow alongside other edible, more constrained plants in a large vitrine planter. Throughout the duration of Little Berlin’s exhibit, Hard To Please, the plant growth in the gallery represents the changing landscapes in America, and how it relates to a slow competition for life.

Owen grew up in rural Western North Carolina among the Smoky Mountains. The area is a temperate rainforest diverse with deciduous and coniferous vegetation. Over the last several decades large swaths of the indigenous landscape have become engulfed by kudzu; a perennial vine native to Asia. Kudzu is venerated in Japan where it’s root is dried and powdered and used as a thickener. There are places in Haywood County, North Carolina and across the southern states of America that are now enveloped by kudzu, where the vines are known to grow up to a foot per day in mid-summer.

Kudzu was introduced to the United States as an ornamental bush and an effortless and efficient shade producer at the Philadelphia Continental Exposition in 1876. In the 1930s and ‘40s, the vine was rebranded as a way for farmers to stop soil erosion. Southern farmers were given about eight dollars an hour to sow topsoil with the invasive vine. The cultivation covered over one million acres of kudzu.(1)

Will Owen is an artist working primarily with design, interactive media, sound, and food. Originally from western North Carolina and currently based in a few city centers of the American northeast, Will is interested in the social intersections of the organic & synthetic, memory & perceived reality, and Fozzie Bear & Miss Piggy. Will is currently an artist in resident at Flux Factory in Queens, New York. Recently, Will had an installation at the original site of the Black Mountain College and was included in a 2014 Harvard peer-reviewed study of the “most memorable data visualizations” regarding his design work for the international medical humanitarian aid organization Doctors Without Borders.

Why should or should we not consider public history participatory art? How should we use the term social practice in 2014? Do any of these questions even matter at all?

An ongoing experiment in aleatoric strategies inspired by the last three novels written by William S. Burroughs II, The third in a trilogy of non-linear exhibitions, The Place of Dead Roads takes its name from the second book in William S. Burroughs’ cataclysmic “Cities” saga. Ciphers, cathartic performance, kinetic machines, and handmade environments mark the break down and reformation of linguistics, symbolic thought, and ritual.
Celebrating the triumph of the Viking Mill at the Hands of the city of Philadelphia License and Inspections, this installation is based on the interaction of individual vision and communal practice; the braiding of sign, signifier, and symbol will draw a thread linking visionary practice, rhythmic interpretation, and cultivation of chance. 
“We’re not fighting for a scrap of sharecropper immortality with the strings hanging off it like Mafioso spaghetti. We want the whole tamale. The Johnsons are taking over the Western Lands. We built it with our brains and our hands. We paid for it with our blood and our lives. It’s ours and we’re going to take it. And we are not applying in triplicate to the Immortality Control Board. Anybody gets in our way we will get our communal back against a rock or a tree and fight the way a raccoon will fight a fucking dog.”

Description of Exhibition:
Exhibit Dates: Jan 18, 2014 – Feb 23, 2014
Location: Constance S. & Robert J. Hennessy Project Space

 

The Philadelphia-based artistic collaborative Little Berlin repurposes the Hennessy Project Space as an improvised art space for Little White Cubes, a curatorial project that contextualizes the gallery as work of art or creative medium. Founded in 2007 by two artists, Little Berlin identifies itself as an “undefined exhibition space” run by approximately ten members who approach curating from a creative, collaborative perspective. Current Little Berlin members treat the DCCA gallery as a makeshift satellite of the actual gallery located in Philadelphia’s Kensington neighborhood. Installing a TV stack for screening documentation of prior events, a “zine” library with armchair seating, a live video feed, and performance area in the gallery, Little Berlin’s treatment of the museum space exemplifies new media experimentation coupled with a do-it-yourself ethos.

Many artists have subverted the presumed neutrality of the “white cube” exhibition space by parodying or critiquing the authority behind a museum’s institutional framework. In 1970, Tom Marioni invented the Museum of Conceptual Art in San Francisco and began his social sculpture, Drinking Beer with Friends is the Highest Form of Art. Kate Ericson and Mel Ziegler’s MoMA Whites (1990) featured a gallery painted with different colors of white preferred by various curators of the Museum of Modern Art. Adopting a paraprofessional identity and working in the genre of Institutional Critique, in the 1990s artist Andrea Frasier delivered a tour as a museum docent, deconstructing museological education and calling the traditional role of the artist into question. Other contemporary artists of the 2000s, such as the Yes Men duo, appropriate corporate identity in order to camouflage themselves as business CEOs in various settings. In current socially engaged artistic practice, many artists increasingly eschew the title of Artist altogether, announcing themselves as politicians, farmers, or urban planners, for example, who treat the gallery as civic center, community garden, or public design studio.

Performance Schedule:
6:00-6:30 warm up with FADE SUNSHINE (Lee Tusman)
Performed by Lee Tusman, Fade Sunshine is a master of high art hype. Mixing hip hop with slow radio and beats with rock n’ roll he gets your knees jerking and elbows flapping in a context unusual for a typical fine art museum. This is the flagship of Tusman’s lable Jewish Noise, and there will be no glitched out remix left behind.

6:30-6:50 MA JA KA
Is the wandering dream body of Marshall James Kavanaugh. Part anima, part unicorn he often can be found playing the trumpet creating vast dreamscapes for others to travel in or working as a dream poet for hire selling stream of subconscious poems. His main function is that of a dream laborer, hypnotizing his audience into a subconscious plane of existence where the mountains are tall, the sun shines bright, and the party is always echoing with good vibes.

7:00-7:20 REV. ERIC DANGER CLARK
Clark attained internet viral success upon the completion of his performance “My Mouth Is Open Because I Am Hungry”, at the Little Berlin Block Party last summer. A stranger posted a photo on the WTF? section of reddit and within minutes it became a trending feed with most viewers wondering what was even happening in the photo much less who this zany person in a gimp suit might be. Is this art?, they asked. Kid today, they said. Clark is a revolutionary of the shock factor performing rituals that even a satanist might find otherworldly.

7:30-7:50 EILEEN LILLIAN DOYLE
Curator of the nationally touring performance festival, Garbage World, Doyle is a world class hero for the avant garde. Many parallels could be made between Doyle and Charlotte Moorman who starting in the 60s single handedly organized 20+ years of the weirdest and wildest avant garde festivals in New York City, bringing together notable characters such as Nam June Paik and John Cage. Doyle works mostly out of Chicago and Philadelphia and her performers, as well as her own station as host, appear no less brilliant.

8:00-9:00 SPACIN’
Spacin’ is a psychedelic rock band based in East Kensington, Philadelphia. Their first LP was put out last year by Richie Records (Kurt Vile, Birds of Maya, Cockcleaner, etc). It offers a refreshing homage to rock n’ roll legends like the Stooges and MC5 while taking on a new paradigm for any Deadhead. The rhythms and blues are far out and made for spacing out.",

Throughout November, artist-run spaces throughout Philadelphia have hosted CITYWIDE: A Collective Exhibition. Now it’s Little Berlin’s turn! Join us this Saturday at Pterodactyl Gallery as we present The Citywide Collections Project. After months of picking up and sorting donated objects left in our collection bins by anonymous collaborators, our efforts have culminated in this odd, surprising, quirky, wry, uncertain assemblage of items. Objects were curated by Little Berlin into ten categories:
Lost,
Found,
Intimate,
From a stranger,
Radical,
Boring,
Valuable,
Worthless,
Missing a part, and
Part of something else.

Hosted by Pterodactyl and featuring refreshments and music, the opening runs from 7-10pm at 3237 Amber St, 5th Floor. We invite you to additional objects meeting one or more of the above criteria to add to the collection throughout the evening.

        ","Little Berlin presents Limits and Demonstrations: A Lula Chamberlain Retrospective, marking the first major posthumous showcase of the little-known pioneering new media installation artist Lula Chamberlain’s work in over twenty years. This groundbreaking exhibition features a virtual museum game presented in a cinema inside the gallery as well as a physical gallery exhibition retrospective. 

Chamberlain was a contemporary of Nam June Paik, John Cage and other avant-garde new media artists. Because her works were never successfully exhibited in public and due to her choice to relocate to Mexico she is not widely known, even amongst the artworld.

The exhibition consists of two parts. Visitors first enter a theater where they collectively play a digital videogame that is a virtual museum environment where Chamberlain’s artworks are shown in their idealized forms. The virtual museum was created by the game development company Cardboard Computer, directed by Jake Elliott and Tamas Kemenczy. The gallery exhibition is curated by Lee Tusman of Little Berlin.

There is a beauty to the virtual museum as the original works share a confounding legacy that they were never successfully displayed in their debut exhibitions as they were nearly impossible to install at the time. Galleries and museums balked at the scale, power requirements, and highly-skilled labor involved in maintaining Chamberlain’s works for display. Some of their debuts collapsed under the weight of logistics. The second part of the gallery exhibition at Little Berlin consists of the actual artworks on loan from collectors, artists, various museums and archives in Mexico and the United State as well as recreated works based on the artist’s original plans where the original has been lost.

Some of the works on display are damaged from deterioration or neglect. One of the most exciting works on display includes the artist’s piece ""Overdubbed Nam June Paik installation, in the style of Edward Packer"" in which Chamberlain, inspired by Robert Rauschenberg’s ""Erased De Kooning Drawing"" overdubbed her own audio onto a Nam June Paik cassette tape installation work.

The degraded installations stand in stark contrast to their idealized forms displayed in the videogame retrospective that shows the strength of the artist’s vision. The pursuit of this exhibition of Chamberlain’s work helps finally bring attention to this neglected but important new media artist. It is hoped that this exhibition is the first of many to come.",

a free showing of two works in progress

Featuring ""Third Party Consequences"" by choreographer Megan Mizanty, in collaboration with composer Sabrina Clarke
and ""Third Human Arm"" by Choreographer Rori Smith, in collaboration with filmmakers Sam Campbell and Claire Truman

Performers: Claire Lutz, Kate Abernethy, Julee Mahon, Emma MacDonald, Sam Campbell, Rori Smith and Claire Truman 

In “Third Party Consequences,” Mizanty explores movement that doesn’t give a shit. She is interested in ‘the butterfly effect,’ and how small decisions made by one body part undually and significantly affects another, for better or worse. Composer Sabrina Clarke works with and against this movement.

In ""Third Human Arm"" dancer Rori Smith and filmmakers Sam Campbell and Claire Truman collaborate to explore the possible uses of Steadicam in live performance. Smith and Truman dance while Campbell operates the Steadicam, a wearable camera mount designed to maintain a smooth and stable picture while the camera operator moves through the performance space. A live video stream from the camera provides the audience a chance to witness the dance from a variety of perspectives, including through the eyes of the dancers. 

The collaboration for Third Human Arm began while Smith and Campbell worked together on a short film. Witnessing Campbell operate the Steadicam, Smith recognized that the craft demands an awareness of the body in space and an attention to movement detail similar to dance. This performance tests how Campbell’s moving body might integrate with the movements of the dancers on stage. The choreography is inspired by the purpose of the Steadicamhi, to maintain stability within uninhibited mobility.",

REPEAT consists of appropriated content, downloaded from the internet, and re-produced. The work explores a range of copyrighted and open source material; all of which is borrowed without the prior knowledge or consent of the original creators.

The purpose the exhibition is to question the legal and ethical implications of re-using readily available, unaltered digital information. REPEAT focuses on the product of converting digital media into physical media. It seeks to understand perceptions of ownership and value, when unique physical objects are re-created, and re-contextualized within a gallery setting. Visitors can expect to see objects including massive vinyl banners, photographic c-prints, cnc routed sintra, life sized foam cut out figures, and a 3d print.


Wednesday, April 24th, 7 – 9pm: 

Little Berlin will host a round table discussion on the topics of appropriation, replication, copyright, creative commons, and ownership.

        ","A social gathering of absurdist performance art, drinks, sun dance, and a crafting of mythology for the New World. The inspiration for the exhibition is derived from Plato’s Republic and the Mayan creationist text the Popol Vuh.

Plato’s Porno Cave

The inspiration for the exhibition is derived from Plato’s Republic and his model for Utopia in the city Kallipolis (or “beautiful city”). In this text, Socrates defines a good city as a city where justice is its main virtue. By combining these ethics with other creationist myths such as the Mayan text, the Popol Vuh, and a surreal month of programming, Plato’s Porno cave seeks to create a mythology for a truly new world.

On Saturday, March 2nd participants will be born again, entering a realm of wonder and radical opposites. Introduced upon them by the Visionaries of the Twin Beard, who created The Machine to Move the Sun, participants will be led through various orgone accumulators, sacrificing the hardships of their past in order to accept the pleasures of the present. The exhibition will be an experiment in economics, science, language, and physical reality and will stand as a stationary structure and event space throughout the month of March as a testament to the New World.",

Burroughs II, The second in a trilogy of non-linear exhibitions, The Western Lands takes its name from the third book in William S. Burroughs’ cataclysmic “Cities” saga. Ciphers, kinetic machines, hallucinatory projections, and home spun environments mark the break down and reformation of linguistics, symbolic thought, and ritual.

This collaborative installation is based on the interaction of individual vision and communal practice; the braiding of sign, signifier, and symbol will draw a thread linking visionary practice, rhythmic interpretation, and cultivation of chance. The First exhibition, staged in 2010, of the Trilogy was “Cities of the Red Night“, images can be found here and here.

As the piranhas attacked the floundering dog, the hysterical starlet threw a heavy bronze ashtray which shattered the tank, spilling snapping fish and bloody water across the patrons as the disemboweled, screaming dog dragged its intestines across the floor. Quite a scene it was, and of course there were plenty of cameras to freeze-dry this edifying spectacle for posterity and export. It’s the little touches that make a future solid enough to be destroyed.”

— William S. Burroughs, The Western Lands, p. 37

Most of the installation was created by the artist on site, working together on their individual spaces and collaborating at porous boundaries, allowing overlap and infiltration. Skirmantas Pipas painted a Lego Last Supper Mural, overlapping with Brian Dunn’s printed security seal pasted wall installation. Danielle Payne projected video and lights with peep holes leading to Jennifer Lingford’s room of disquieted, Lynchian/Cronebergian Domestic Decay. Sedakial Gebremedhin, Mike Schultis, and Scott Cooper installed raw earth to enact a mining/Goldshlager drenched performance. Tim Eads unleashed his painting machines to build the foundation of his wind and light installation. Marek Danielewski created the interior of a crypto-sociographic Sarcophagi. Lucia Thomé pierced the space with a tilted and deformed geometric structure that dominates a surrounding workshop, and Tom Yurkovic built an illuminated stairway confronting the viewer with interior, exterior, and reflective views. Salvatore Cerceo and Jim Huebotter brought in manually propelled kinetic sculptures, Conor Fields unleashes his motor driven Das Boot madness and The Justice League of Adversaries performed original electronic composition and video project in the courtyard, where CIPRO‘s street art stream of consciousness has transformed the exterior area of the gallery.

Please join on First Friday Dec 2nd from 6-10 PM for the closing reception of this exhibition, with new music and performance.

There is an additional exhibition within the installation, bring stickers and markers to decorate the cardboard walls of the installations labrynth.

July 2011,https://little-berlin.squarespace.com/calendar/2011/7/9/materialism-of-encounter,Materialism of Encounter,MATERIALISM OF ENCOUNTER,"Saturday, July 9, 2011","“Being ‘materialistic’ does not mean sticking to the triteness of facts nor does it imply a narrow mindedness that consists in reading works in purely economic terms.”

                                                                                                              - Nicholas Bourriaud

Materialism of Encounter examines the transformation of objects and ideas as they become points of departure, reference and contact. We are able to investigate other’s relationships as well as our own relationships with elements of our landscapes and spaces by rendering them from their origins and into a state of encounter in a neutral setting.

Conor Backman re-creates pre-existing objects that are widely familiar with craft and humorist irony. Through the process of re-making and appropriating he creates a new, unfamiliar experience for these objects.

Matthew Brett creates a series of relationships between objects that are otherwise banal. Through replication, (casting, painting, carving, etc…) these recognizable, everyday objects have been frozen and rendered false. The result being physical memories in a mental landscape where the relationships between objects grow more complex and the importance of the individual artifacts fade.

Sean Kuhnke and Bryan Jabs examine the way people interact with printed material in a social experiment about the commodification of art and interactivity. Their work engages viewers through an uncommon form of distribution of printed media, investigating its role in both private and public space.

Alexandra Barao captures and appropriates elements of nature in a way that is rough and unedited resulting in a transitory and meditative video that reminds us of the comforting wonder of our immediate landscape. Her videos illustrate a time when, in a need to feel grounded, the artist begins to draw from what is directly around them for inspiration.

Joanie Turbek attempts to re-create the sensation of a rainstorm, particularly through it’s construction. The result is a setting that is soothing and familiar. Joanie approaches the re-appropriation of nature in a way that is minimal and humble, making the production and craft secondary to the actual experience that she has created, allowing the viewer to sit by the window and watch the rain.

Masha Badinter focuses on moments in her memory that she believes can be reconstructed as universal grounds for feeling. She uses elements of architecture and light to convey a past experience with an emphasis on the relationship between people and spaces. Although the narrative is from her own memory it is an open narrative that others can complete.

In closing the lecture series little berlin invites artist, Carl Diehl to perform/lecture case studies related to his Metaphortean Research. This gesture pairs science fiction with the art form, inviting discourse within the non-empirical avenues of science.

After the lecture, there will be massive amounts of celebration.

From metaphortean.wordpress.org:
The neologized term “Metaphortean” combines “metaphor” and “Fortean,” the latter term denoting strange, mysterious events popularized in the publications of the independent early 20th century researcher Charles Fort. An eccentric champion of anomalous phenomena, Fort collected facts that had allegedly been excluded, rejected, or ignored by established science because they were unexplainable. While Fort focused on the arbitrary borderlines between accepted and denied explanations, Metaphortean Research puzzles the shifting values associated with new and obsolescent media.

An official, if speculative, genealogy of Metaphortean Research to be presented at Little Berlin gallery in Philadelphia on Saturday May 28th.

November 2010,https://little-berlin.squarespace.com/calendar/2010/11/9/landscape-techne,Landscape Techne,LANDSCAPE TECHNE,"Tuesday, November 9, 2010","Landscape Techne intends to maintain the legacy of the relationship of the artist and technology while exploring the role of landscape in art. Landscape as a genre was originally influenced by a physical panoramic view, limited at times to a specific region. It has remained a long time object of affection for the artist, as it has been translated since the frescoes of Minoan Greece. The objective of Landscape Techne is to initiate dialogue about the manner in which artists are challenging the way landscape art is conveyed and experienced based on the insistent mutation of the artist’s toolbox. The artists chosen for this exhibition use land as a significant element in their work and utilize various formats of expression from the i-phone to the virtual world program Second Life. Landscape Techne aims to provide some insight as to why landscape has survived as a theme in fine art and how technology and social change have influenced the way artists consider it as content.

The techne element of the title was inspired by an explanation of the Greek root word provided by Tom Boellstorff in his book Coming of Age in Second Life:

“Techne refers to art of craft, to human action that engages with the world and thereby results in a different world. Techne is not just knowledge about the world, what Greek thought termed episteme; it is intentional action that constitutes a gap between the world as it was before the action, and the new world it calls in to being.”

Friday, January 8th – Saturday, January 30th 2010
Opening Reception Friday, January 8th 6-10 PM

The word home is by definition a many faceted term. It can be used as a noun, verb, adverb, and adjective according to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary. In it’s most common usage, as a noun, Merriam and Webster give us six sub definitions of home:

1. One’s place of residence: domicile: house
2. The social unit formed by a family living together
3. A familiar or usual setting: congenial environment; also: the focus of one’s attention
4. A place of origin; one’s own country
5. An establishment providing residence and care for people with special needs
6. The objective in various games

The point being that home is many things, and it is always specific to the individual. We use the word in common phrases such as, “I’m going home for the holidays.”, “Home is where the heart is.”, “I’m headed home after work.”, in which we all understand what the meaning and intent. But in truth home differs from person to person. The history and context of peoples lives define what home is to them. That definition is specific to that person alone. Siblings may come and go to the same “home” but their memories and experiences in that place are not the same. The idea of home changes over time as well. When a person is young home is where they are being raised, but that changes as they grow older and move onto new places. We may know our homes like the back of our metaphorical hands, but is that the physical elements of the house we grew up in? Is it the attitudes of the people that occupy a place? Is it all of these things? There are many people who do not have a single place that they call home. What do nomadic groups consider to be home? Or foster children who jump from family to family? Or an adolescent who moves to a different country?

This is the Only Place that Can Save My Heart looks at a variety of perspectives on this issue. Each artist has a different perception of the power and definition of home. This place, or people, or feeling has an impact on the work that the artists make. Some of the artists address the issue of home directly, while some use the people, places, and things they think of as home as spring boards for their art making. Nostalgia, memory, historical context, and architecture as icon are just a few of the ideas that are examined in this exhibition.",

""The exhibit is co-curated by Martha Savery and Alex Gartelmann and centers around a stunning feat of organizational chaos:
80 Philadelphia area artists, who happen to be strangers, working collaboratively in twenty groups.

This 10-week project includes participants from a variety of backgrounds, both established and emerging: visual artists, performers, writers, biologists and anthropologists. Loosely prompted by the concept of ""offerings"" and a budgetary limit of $50 per group, the artists set about getting to know each other and attempting to find common ground. Designed to allow the artists to push the boundaries of their studio practices, Offerings has the added bonus of exposing disparate artists within the groups to new resources right here in their own city. The main intent of Offerings has been to create new connections between artists here in Philadelphia. Each group will have had a unique experience. It is hoped that when this project comes to an end the participating artists will have new people to work and share thoughts with, new resources to aid or add to their making process, and the potential for new opportunities to show and share their work. 

The show itself will feature performance, video work, drawings, photography and much more that is yet unknown to the show's organizers.
Teetering on the edge of impossibility, it is the most ambitious and surprising exhibition produced by Little Berlin so far.""

‘This is the End’ Exhibition Opens Friday, May 1 at Little Berlin

PHILADELPHIA, 2009 - Americans find themselves in a time of multiple endings. The end of prosperous financial markets. The end of the natural world as we know it. Cheap energy, newspapers, the power of domestic cars – all are ending. It is easy to let the pessimism of all these endings overwhelm us. When things end, they stop, they die; yet life is cyclical and while some things cease, others will postpone, adapt or even start anew.

In response to this period of multiple cessations, Little Berlin presents the exhibition, This is the End. The obvious finalities are depicted – the end of mankind and the end of life, but some more subtle readings are represented as well. The end of youth, the end of possessions, the end of aspirations – are all portrayed. The opening reception for the show is First Friday, May 1, from 6:00 – 10:00 pm. The exhibition will be open to the public from May 1 through May 30 on Saturdays from 12:00 – 5:00 pm and by appointment. 

This is the End was curated by Little Berlin collective member, Robert T. Pannell. The exhibition’s artists include Jon Bobby Benjamin, Ellie Brown, Justin Bursk, Jen Coluzzi, Lew Death, Conor Fields, Juan Garcia, Jenna Hannum, Morgan Hill, Terrence Laragione, Max Maddox, Amanda Miller, Christine Mladic, James Munson, Erin M.

Un-Nature- A four person show featuring Adam Bush, Nathaniel Butler, Katie Elia, and Bonnie Brenda Scott, curated by Alex Gartelmann.

Un-Nature is a contemporary examination of the synthesis of man, nature, and science through visual creation. The language these artists create is one of a grotesque Romanticism. At its core, Romanticism is a reaction to the scientific rationalization of nature, stemming from the 18th century. The work in this exhibition is a reaction to the hyper rationalization we face in the 21st century. The artists create an innate emotional image in response to a culture that is very aware of science and its role in nature. Unlike 18th century Romantic thought, the anthropomorphic relationship of the artist's chosen image steers away from the beauty of nature. Instead, the artists look at the ugly underside of nature and its interconnectedness with human beings.",
