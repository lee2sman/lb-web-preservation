Grace Berman is an artist living and working in Philadelphia. She currently uses a variety of ceramic techniques to create functional work. She is inspired by wandering through the city with her eyes partially glued to her phone and repetitive domestic anxieties. In decorative motifs she  strives to nail down representations of a vague memory soup.

His range of adoptive methods includes painting, producing sculptures, printing photographs, dancing, making noises, and growing mushrooms. His work is a practice of repetitions and reversals, it’s all about analogy, mysticism, and chiasmus. When you take time to appreciate an artwork, it takes the same time and appreciates you. www.christopherrichardsart.com

Sarah is a video artist whose work explores the relationship between subjective and objective emotionality, navigating daily life and relationships while faced with mental illness, and breaking down stereotypes of gender and narrative. The living embodiment of the correlation between chronic depression and binge watching practices, her work consists of appropriating and manipulating found footage from movies, music videos and television. She also likes to use text, performance and elements of karaoke (which she is obsessed with but has never actually performed IRL) to create recognizable narrative structures that can be viewed in and outside the academy of art. Sarah studied at the Film and Television School of Performing Arts (FAMU) in Prague and received her BFA from Syracuse University.  ",SARAH TRAD,"Sarah is a video artist whose work explores the relationship between subjective and objective emotionality, navigating daily life and relationships while faced with mental illness, and breaking down stereotypes of gender and narrative.

SIYUAN LIUsiyuanliuart.comThis body of work references political propaganda posters. The portrait of the Chinese leader Mao Zedong is a deep collective memory of every single Chinese citizen. We’ve have been taught to be a patriot since our birth. Just like the rock song said we are the balls/eggs under the red flag. Currently, in China and especially in some undeveloped areas, the figure of Mao has still consecrated a god-- a savior of people. Chinese left-wing politicians and scholars still promote propaganda if his ideologies in print images both in poster form and on the internet. In contrast, in the capitalist world, Mao is considered as an evil dictator and tyrant. In my opinion, we should provide an objective definition of this figure instead of the extremely biased read from history. I have chosen his portrait because it is symbolic, powerful, controversial, and it contains complex meanings.The draperies and cloths have three meanings for me. First, it is an important memory of my childhood. When I started to draw and sketch at the age of six, the lights and shades of the drapery were difficult to render because fabric folds are soft, changing, and the shading complicated. I admired the western masters since they could paint the draperies and cloths realistically. Depicting fabric is important to me because the material holds the cultural and historical reference. The invention of fabric is a significant symbol if civilization. Human beings use the cloth to protect themselves from the hostile environment and extreme weather, as well as to cover their private body parts which means the social structure tended to stable because of the sense of proprietorship of sex. Lastly, the father of Chinese rock and roll Cui Jian wrote a famous song “ A Piece of Red Cloth” in 1988. This song describes his struggle in a romantic relationship. However, there are many political metaphors underneath such as the first lyrics that day you used a piece of red cloth to cover my eyes and the sky. The red cloth can be considered as the color of the communist party and the Chinese flag. This song connected romantic love and political realities together to create an unusual and ambiguous atmosphere. Furthermore, the fear of the authority, as well as the implicit expression of feelings, the metaphor is the most important part in Chinese literature in history.In the series titled Protection, I cut draperies and cloth pieces from my collection of western master painting books to cover Mao’s portrait with multiple compositions. Then, I utilized Photoshop to adjust the color tone. The final step is to print multiple large posters like images using a high-quality fine art printer. In the series of work, I redefine the meaning of the process of collage as a method instead of a result because the printed posters contain the meaning of mechanical reproductions and delivering the message which is the political propaganda in modern history. The ambiguity is also an important aspect of my work. The defacing of Mao could be considered an insult or a criticism. On closer inspection, the viewer will see that the thick paint across the image is actually drapery and cloth, and the meaning of protection emerges. Lastly, another layer of ambiguity is that am I preventing the viewer from seeing Mao’s face, and simultaneously, blocking Mao’s gaze at us? ",,"This body of work references political propaganda posters.

Amalia Wiatr Lewis is an interdisciplinary dance artist. Her dance work asks questions of space, time, and relationships through the exploration of idiosyncratic gesture, somatic practices, and improvisational scores. Her current movement practice uses abstract experiments to explore ideas of domesticity, gender politics, internal psyches, and the self and the other.

 She also makes functional ceramics and sometimes photographs the funny aspects of our built environment.

www.rebekahflake.comRebekah Flake uses visual arts and curation to investigate nostalgia and tourism at sites where national identities are exhibited in contemporary culture. Her interdisciplinary practice is based in Philadelphia: the location of the Declaration of Independence and the political birthplace of the American Revolution. She grew up in Mississippi, which has had its own struggle with national definitions. She is specifically interested in places contained within the political boundary of a nation or city. Through documentary and research-based work, she speaks to the intersection of social history and phenomenological experience at play between the material world and personal identifications with place. In her current body of work, called Niagara Files, she creates images and programming to promote reflection on citizenship in North America. The narrative centers on her claiming Canadian citizenship on the basis of her mother’s birth in British Columbia; however, the project is simultaneously a reflection on the history of migration and settlement on our continent and the extent to which all North Americans can relate to some version of a migration narrative.She received an MFA in 2014 from Tyler School of Art and an MA in 2009 from the Williams College Graduate Program in the History of Art.   PROJECTS AT LITTLE BERLINSWING STATE Magali Duzant: A Means to MeasureUnusually HumanOffice Hours with Suzanne Seesman",REBEKAH FLAKE,"www.rebekahflake.com

Her work makes use of a wide range of media—including oils, embroidery, sand, and even digital experimentation such as short animations and gifs.Her work has been on display across the country, and prominent pieces include a mixed media and digital sculpture housing a hidden projector on display in Philadelphia, and an interpretive illustration commissioned for a nationally aired PBS documentary.Strange and saccharine, her work is informed by the moment when you are both charmed and disquieted by a thing—a process that has always been especially visual for her. This liminal space—where you can’t always tell what you are looking at—is universal. It is at once totally alien, and completely commonplace.Her work seeks to speak to a vast array of audiences, while at once asking them to confront a very personal delight and discomfort. To carve that moment out, and create from it its own world that is both incredibly honest, and essentially subjective.Although she titles her work based on the stories that they present to her, she seeks to create work that is as variable as its audience—to create an experience that appears differently to every viewer.

Reverend Eric Danger Clark is a Philadelphia based installation and performance artist. He received his BFA in Printmaking and Sculpture from Rowan University in 2011 and his MFA from the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in 2013 in performance and sculpture. His work is within a one man religion setting up shrines and rituals that involve the audience asking them to do more than passively accept an environment or situation but be challenged by it and challenge back. He also runs a service to cheaply bring performance art to events. He loves useless objects and futile experiences.Past Curatorial / Exhibition Work at Little Berlin:July 2013: Garbage World 7July 2014: Between The Act And Motion: Little Berlin at Artscape in Baltimore",REV.

Adam Lovitz, an artist and resident of Philadelphia, utilizes the solitary act of painting and the collaborative component of performance to nurture daily creativity.  While his paintings and imagery strive to slow down the process of seeing, Adam is interested in a more versatile sensory experience found in performance.  Produced with several other Philly makers, the collective !!!!!!!!!!!KEEP IT UP is a ritual of experimentation, dialogue, and play. Adam attained his BFA from University of Delaware and his MFA from Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.

Erin Bernard  feels strongly that access matters and that all spaces are museums and galleries if we just treat them as they are. As the founder and chief curator of the Philadelphia Public History Truck, she is exploring one path to dismantling access issues in history museums and cultural spaces. Her work focuses on empowering urban communities to create together and hold conversations involving multiple generations and neighborhood stakeholders. She also is particularly interested in capturing and archiving histories which might not be documented otherwise.As an M.A. public history candidate at Temple University and artist, she is exploring the utility of community curating and the effectiveness of nontraditional museum spaces. Her thesis will be about the aesthetics of public history with case studies of mobile projects, including her own. Her process involves letting questions originate in the community, interpreting oral history in tangible ways, and writing counter-narratives to inform installation and exhibition. She is particularly interested in using maps to present memories in juxtaposition with difficult facts. Her inspirations are Fred Wilson, Theaster Gates, Rebecca Solnit, and Alfredo Jaar.Erin is a thrilled to be a member of Little Berlin and an active part of the Fairgrounds project. She works as the Publicity, Engagement and Outreach Associate of the 45-year-old Painted Bride Art Center in Old City, Philadelphia. In the past, she has taught special education in Bronx, NY and is continuously driven to connect children to the humanities to inspire transformative creation.

Alex Walcroft is a Philadelphia based multimedia artist. His work explores the constraints of identity, our day-to-day social transactions, and the blurry relationship between storytelling and experience. As a curator at Little Berlin, he sought these themes in the work of fellow Philadelphia artists, and in June of 2013, developed a show called “Gone Shadowing” around the work he found. He received a BFA in Sculpture with a minor in Art History from Tyler School of Art in 2012, and was a Gallery Assistant, then Curatorial Member at Little Berlin from January 2012-December 2013.Past Exhibitions at Little Berlin:March 2012: Flash Fl00dAugust 2012: HUNG: Little Berlin Members ShowJune 2013: Gone ShadowingJuly 2013: Garbage World 7 www.alexwalcroft.com ",ALEX WALCROFT,"Alex Walcroft is a Philadelphia based multimedia artist.

Caitlin McCormack became a member late in the winter of 2012. Although she was only able to sustain her affiliation with the space for just over half-a-year, the experience proved to be fulfilling. She was able to facilitate a screening of One 11 with 103 to celebrate the John Cage Centennial, and to co-organize an outdoor performance featuring the Minor Arcana and several Philadelphia-area poets. She assisted with the development of the Fairgrounds and participated in the 2012 member exhibition, Hung. The efforts put forth by each member in order to support the gallery and all of its enterprises provided her with a greater understanding of how such spaces operate. Her appreciation for similar establishments increased tremendously as a result of her brief alliance with Little Berlin.McCormack is currently working as a fine artist in Philadelphia, utilizing media such as stiffened cotton string resembling bone tissue. She is constantly striving to construct a personal taxonomy through the collation of symbols embedded in esoteric contexts, primarily using skeletal animal forms. She has most recently received representation from Paradigm Gallery + Studio and exhibited work at Select Fair during Art Basel week in Miami.http://www.caitlintmccormack.com/ Past Curatorial / Exhibition Work at Little Berlin:August 2012: HUNG: Little Berlin Members Show",CAITLIN MCCORMACK,"Caitlin McCormack became a member late in the winter of 2012.
